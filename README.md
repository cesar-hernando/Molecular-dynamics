# Project 1: Molecular dynamics simulation of Argon atoms

In this project, we perform a Molecular Dynamics simulation of a system of Argon atoms.
We retrieve a variety of observables, such as kinetic and potential energy, diffusion, specific heat and pair correlation,
and investigate their behavior in a systematic and quantitative way by compare them over different phases of matter.

The MD simulation can be executed by entering the command 'python3 main.py' in the terminal (MacOs). The necessary requirements can be found in the accompanying
file 'requirements.txt''. To control simulation or animation parameters, please refer to the file 'parameters.py'.
